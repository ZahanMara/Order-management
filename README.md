# Order-management

The objective of the application is to design and implement an application aiming to process customer orders and proceed various type of operations on a database, such as: insert, update, find and delete. 
A database is a system for storing and taking care of data. A database engine can change or serve information on the database. The data in a database is organized in some way.
This application should be able to fulfil all the requirements in order to display, modify, and keep track of orders, clients and products. 
These are stored in a relational MySQL database, along with the information about the users which have access to the system. 
This way, all the data is easier to retrieve and access from different computers.

Furthermore, the application is structured in packages using a layered architecture and contains the following classes: 
• Model classes - the data models of the application 
• Business Logic classes – implement the application logic 
• Presentation classes – implement the user input/output 
• Data access classes - implement the access to the database 
The application allows processing commands from a text file given as argument, perform the requested operations, save the data in the database, and generate reports in pdf format.
